Description:
In this lecture, we explore support vector machines in some mathematical detail.
We use Lagrange multipliers to maximize the width of the street given certain constraints.
If needed, we transform vectors into another space, using a kernel function.

0. General:
Dictionary:
- vapid       =  banal
- shrunk      = fall around
- sore        = painful, hurt
- varnacular  = form of a language that a particular group of speakers use naturally, especially in informal situations
- resuscitate = ressurect
- epiphanous  = sudden intuitive insight

- [PRINCIPLE]: WHEN STUCK, SWITCH TO ANOTHER PRINCIPLE
- Different countries form, because there are different cultures. Different cultures form, because people live in
  different locations. Different locations have different climatic and atmosperic conditions, which yield different crops and influence
  the behavior of the people [URL: https://worldview.earthdata.nasa.gov/?p=geographic&l=VIIRS_SNPP_CorrectedReflectance_TrueColor,MODIS_Aqua_CorrectedReflectance_TrueColor,MODIS_Terra_CorrectedReflectance_TrueColor,Reference_Labels(hidden),Reference_Features(hidden),Coastlines(hidden)&t=2017-09-19&z=3&v=33.24422940340912,14.72917036576699,77.43563565340912,39.47917036576699]

0.5. History of Supporting Vector Machines:
- Author: Vladimir Vapnik: Immigrated from USSR in 1991
- He did the basic version of SVM in his PhD thesis in Moscow University in 1960s. But they didn't have any computers to try it
- He is invited by Bell Labs to USA. In 1993 he sends 3 papers to NIPS (Neural Information Processing  Systems). They are rejected. 
- Bell-Labs was interested in hand-written letter recognition and neural nets
- Vapnik despised neural nets. He bets that SVM can do better hand-writing recognition than neural nets. It was a dinner bet.
- Napoleon: "It's amazing to see what a soldier will do for a bit of ribbon"

1. Introduction:
- How to divide a space with [decision boundaries]

2. Support Vector Machines:
- [Widest S treet Approach]: The widest street which separates the [positive] from the [negative] examples
- It tries to place the line in a such way, that the street is as wide as possible
- [?] How do you make a rule to find that decision boundary?
- [decision rule] -> [decision boundary]

- [dot product]: http://www.falstad.com/dotproduct/
  The dot product tells you what amount of one vector goes in the direction of another. 
  For instance, if you pulled a box 10 meters at an inclined angle, there is a horizontal component and a vertical component to 
  your force vector. So the dot product in this case would give you the amount of force going in the direction of the displacement, 
  or in the direction that the box moved

- [dot product] is used in order to measure the distance from one example to the [median of the street] 
  (line of separation between - and + examples)
- [Image 04]:
  [dot product] particularly, the projection of the [unknown example] is projected towards the perpendicular vector to the median.
  The projection (dot product) gives us the distance to the median. Thus, it informs us whether the next point is in [left] or [right] side

- Problems: we dont know what vector [w] to use (blue) and what [b] to use => not enough constraints so far
- New formula [Image 06]: All samples are separated by the interval [-1, +1] 
- Introducing [y.i] which is: [Image 07]
                y.i = -1 - negative examples
                y.i = +1 - positive examples
                y.i = 0  - examples in the gutter region (the middle of the "wide street")

- Calculating the width of the street: [positive vector] - [negative vector]
- [unit vector]: magnitude = 1. New vectors can be scaled from the unit vector (1 x 2.5 = 2.5)

- Maximizing the width of the street:
  [Lagrange multipliers] are being used: searching for gradient vectors which both are perpendicular at the touch point between the
  the limiting condition and the function
- We need to differentiate with respect to [w] (Take the derivative with respect to Lagrang e multipliers)
- [w] turns out to be a linear sum of the samples (for some alpha will be " 0" )
- [derivative] = slope of a line between two points (how fast a function changes)
- [derivatives]: the more the distance between the two points which are being differentiated, the greater the approximation rate is (loss of accuracy)
- We found out: the optimization depends on the pairs of dot product of examples [w * w]

3. Demo: Supporting Vector Machines
- [convex space]: SVM have a convex space. It can _never_ get stuck in a local maximum, unlike neural networks
- [Image 17]: Linearly inseparable examples: It struggles, and eventually gives up on a solution which renders few of the points with errors
- With linearly inseparable examples, it requires the [space] to be transformed to one which makes it possible to separate the points
- [PRINCIPLE]: When stuck, change perspective

4. Space transformation. Kernel function:
- It's a user-specified function which transfors the features (transforms the/to  space):
  For many algorithms that solve these tasks, the data in raw representation have to be explicitly transformed into feature vector 
  representations via a user-specified feature map: in contrast, kernel methods require only a user-specified kernel, i.e., 
  a similarity function over pairs of data points in raw representation.
- [Kernel function]: We basically transform the vector pairs 
- [kernel function]: provide a dot product of the vectors in another space
- kernel types:
    *) linear kernel (n=1,2,3...): Vapnik used this with n=2 for hand-writing recognition and it worked very well 
    *) radial basis kernel: if a too small [sigma] is selected, overfitting will happen 
- SVM: A convex method (with only one maximum), guaranteed to produce a global solution
- SVM: Prone to overfitting, but protected against local maxima
- SVM: It's an essential part to use a [kernel method]
- Great ideas, followed by periods of nothing happening, followed by an epiphanous moment when the original idea seemed to have a great 
  power with a little twist.
- It took Vapnik 30 years. Today, everybody dealing with machine learning knows his method
